    "**Programming 4.1** In the tutorial section, we discussed *stacks* and *queues* implemented using arrays or linked lists as the underlying data structure. In this exercise, you are asked to implement a stack based on a linked list. This exercise should give you practice in using *malloc* to make nodes, filling up the fields within nodes, and abstracting implementation details into functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should have at least the operations (functions) *makeStack*, *push*, *pop*. Having an operation to check whether the stack is *empty* is also a good idea. Separate each stack operation into a different function! The functions should take a pointer to the stack (list) as an argument, so that multiple queues can operate within a program using the same functions, and possibly arguments, such as the item to be pushed.\n",
