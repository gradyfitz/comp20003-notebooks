    "**Question 4.1** A *stack* is an abstract data structure that behaves much like a stack of books on a desk: The newest additions go on top, and the newest additions are also the first to come off the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Show:\n",
    "- How you could implement a stack using an array as the underlying data structure. Think about how you would deal with the situation where the stack is full.\n",
    "- How you would implement the stack using a linked list as the underlying data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 4.2** A *queue* is an abstract data structure that behaves much like a queue in a grocery shop: The newest additions to the queue go at the end (tail, and items are taken out of the queue and processed from the front (head).\n",
    "\n",
    "Show:\n",
    "- How you could implement a queue using an array as the underlying data structure. Think about how you would deal with the situation where the queue is full. Discuss whether a *circular array* can be used.\n",

    "## Programming exercises\n",
    "**Programming 4.1** In the tutorial section, we discussed *stacks* and *queues* implemented using arrays or linked lists as the underlying data structure. In this exercise, you are asked to implement a stack based on a linked list. This exercise should give you practice in using *malloc* to make nodes, filling up the fields within nodes, and abstracting implementation details into functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should have at least the operations (functions) *makeStack*, *push*, *pop*. Having an operation to check whether the stack is *empty* is also a good idea. Separate each stack operation into a different function! The functions should take a pointer to the stack (list) as an argument, so that multiple queues can operate within a program using the same functions, and possibly arguments, such as the item to be pushed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an extra challenge, consider how you would free all the memory used by the stack once your program is finished with it."

    "**Programming Challenge 4.1** In this challenge, you will write part of the LZ77 compression algorithm, used in a number of leading compression algorithms today. The process will be to add characters to a stack one by one, when you meet a different character, or the end of the string, you should pop all items from the stack, counting how many items you added and then printing out the character followed by the number of times it repeats. The output of your program could be used as a preliminary step to build an LZ77 implementation which could quickly consider more input at the same time.\n",
