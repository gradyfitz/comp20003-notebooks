    "**Programming Challenge 3.1** You've been put in charge of part of the UN dance party, a formal dance party celebrating the first year in quite some time without any country changing their flag. As part of this party, you have a number of guests of honour coming. Your guests of honour may be on peaceful terms, but a few countries are still not on particularly good terms and have said, in no uncertain terms, that they do not want to be partnered with certain countries for PR purposes. Knowing you're an expert programmer taking an impressive sounding \"Algorithms and Data Structures\" subject, the UN has asked you to write a program to find a set of pairings of dancers that does not violate any of the pairs which don't want to be paired.
