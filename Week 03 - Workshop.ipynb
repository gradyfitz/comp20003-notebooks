    "**Programming Challenge 2.2** The technology stack at Hidebound Inc. uses a subset of C which doesn't have the '.' or '->' operators, as the higher-ups heard shortcuts like this were useful in an activity called \"code golfing\" and, misunderstanding what that meant, wanted to discourage all recreational activities on company time. The change improved compile times and required resources slightly so the developer in charge of that performance was happy to force the change on the other programmers in the company. In this challenge, you'll need to replace a piece of code which does this using both the simple '->' and '.' operators with a piece of code that instead changes the value in the struct by using value casting and pointer addition instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge is intended to highlight that '.' and '->' are merely shortcuts to other dereference operations and though you will eventually find your code is less messy when using them, understanding exactly what you are doing will reduce the number of errors you make and allow you to examine code closely when you have something complicated that isn't doing exactly what you think it should be. You may find reading through the (2nd) extra workshop material document on the LMS under the Resources section is particularly useful for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a hint, you may find the offsetof macro useful (you can find this using the *man* pages). For an extra challenge, try only using the sizeof macro, the address of operator (&) and the dereference operator (\\*). Note also that for the latter, a process known as \"packing\" may sometimes add holes to structs which are unused, though that has been carefully avoided in the struct defined here."
