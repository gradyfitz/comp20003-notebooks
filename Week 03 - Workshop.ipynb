The change improved compile times and required resources slightly so the developer in charge of that performance was happy to force the change on the other programmers in the company. In this challenge, you'll need to replace a piece of code which does this using both the simple '->' and '.' operators with a piece of code that instead changes the value in the struct by using value casting and pointer addition instead.\n",

You may find reading through the (2nd) extra workshop material document on the LMS under the Resources section is particularly useful for this task.\n",
